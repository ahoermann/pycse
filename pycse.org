This is a collection of examples of using python in the kinds of scientific and engineering computations I have used in classes and research. They are organized by topics.


I recommend the Continuum IO Anaconda python distribution (https://www.continuum.io). This distribution is free for academic use, and cheap otherwise. It is pretty complete in terms of mathematical, scientific and plotting modules. All of the examples in this book were created run with the Anaconda python distribution.
