# Welcome to pycse - Python Computations in Science and Engineering

There are three main areas of content here:

1. The pycse book - these are notes from a course in mathematical modeling I teach at CMU.
2. The pycse blog - these are from a series of blog posts that I wrote over the past decade
3. pycse documentation - these are generated from docstrings in the pycse module I wrote.
