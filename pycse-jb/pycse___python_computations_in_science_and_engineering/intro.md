# Welcome to pycse - Python Computations in Science and Engineering

There are three main areas of content here:

1. [The pycse book](./book/intro.md) - these are notes from a course in mathematical modeling I teach at CMU.
2. [The pycse blog](./blog/intro.md) - these are from a series of blog posts that I wrote over the past decade
3. [pycse documentation](docs/pycse.rst) - these are generated from docstrings in the pycse module I wrote.
