The problem of interest is:\n\n$y'''(x) - x^2 y = -x^4$ with $y(0)=0, y'(0)=0, y(2)=4$.\n\nThis will take some steps, so read the following carefully. Some of these steps will be worked out, and others you will be asked to complete. You *do not need to derive these*, they are here to guide what you will do.\n\nFirst, we recall that the general solution of a linear ODE can be written as a linear combination of solutions to the homogeneous equation (where the right hand side is zero) and a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation (where the right hand side in this case is $-x^4$).\n\nHere are the homogeneous versions and the particular version of the equation above, expressed in *initial value form*. The initial conditions are chosen here to provide three linearly independent functions $Y_1, Y_2$, and $Y_3$. For $Y_p$ any values can be used since any particular solution will do.\n\n$Y_1''' - x^2 Y_1 = 0$ with $Y_1(0)=1, Y_1'(0)=0, Y_1''(0)=0$\n\n$Y_2''' - x^2 Y_2 = 0$ with $Y_2(0)=0, Y_2'(0)=1, Y_2''(0)=0$\n\n$Y_3''' - x^2 Y_3 = 0$ with $Y_3(0)=0, Y_3'(0)=0, Y_3''(0)=1$\n\n$Y_p''' - x^2 Y_p = -x^4$ with $Y_p(0)=0, Y_p'(0)=0, Y_p''(0)=0$\n\nThese can be combined to form the general solution to the differential equation.\n\n$y(x) = C_1 Y_1(x) + C_2 Y_2(x) + C_3 Y_3(x) + Y_p(x)$\n\nTo get towards a solution to the original BVP, we next apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $C_i$.\n\n$y(0) = 0 = C_1 + 0 + 0 + 0$\n\n$y'(0) = 0 = 0 + C_2 + 0 + 0$\n\n$y(2) = 4 = C_1 Y_1(2) + C_2 Y_2(2) + C_3 Y_3(2) + Y_p(2)$\n\nCombined, these lead to:\n\n$y(x) = \\frac{4 - Y_p(2)}{Y_3(2)} Y_3(x) + Y_p(x)$ where $Y_p(2)$ means the function $Y_p$ evaluated at $x=2$ and $Y_3(2)$ means the function $Y_3$ evaluated at $x=2$.\n\nThat is remarkably the solution to the boundary value problem originally stated, and we can now get $Y_3$ and $Y_p$ by integrating two *ordinary initial value* differential equations!\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Solve for $Y_3$ and $Y_p$\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Find solutions to these two initial value ODEs over the range of $x=0$ to $x=2$:\n\n$Y_3''' - x^2 Y_3 = 0$ with $Y_3(0)=0, Y_3'(0)=0, Y_3''(0)=1$\n\nNote that in the next step you will need to evaluate $Y_3(2)$ and $Y_p(2)$.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["$Y_p''' - x^2 Y_p = -x^4$ with $Y_p(0)=0, Y_p'(0)=0, Y_p''(0)=0$\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Combine them to get a solution to the BVP\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Use your solutions to create the overall solution. $Y_p(2)$ means evaluate $Y_p(x)$ at $x=2$. $Y_3(2)$ means evaluate $Y_3(x)$ at $x=2$.
