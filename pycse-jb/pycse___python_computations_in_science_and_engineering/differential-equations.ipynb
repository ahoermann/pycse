    "Bessel's equation $x^2 y'' + x y' + (x^2 - \\nu^2)y=0$ comes up often in engineering problems such as heat transfer. The solutions to this equation are the Bessel functions. To solve this equation numerically, we must convert it to a system of first order ODEs. This can be done by letting $z = y'$ and $z' = y''$ and performing the change of variables:\n",
