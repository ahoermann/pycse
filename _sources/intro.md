# Welcome to pycse - Python Computations in Science and Engineering

[2023-06-08 Thu] Work is a transition from the org-mode source to Jupyter book. I do not have a timeline for finishing it.

You can find an older [pdf](https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse/blob/master/pycse.pdf) with all the previous content. The original org-mode content is at https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse/tree/master/pycse-chapters.

This content was created from a series of blog posts that began more than 10 years ago. I have collected these, and ordered them in ways that make some sense. Python has changed over these years, and some things may be out of date, or not in the current style. I have only lightly modified these in converting from org-mode to notebooks. The most notable changes are changing the org-files to use Jupyter-python instead of the plain Python blocks.
